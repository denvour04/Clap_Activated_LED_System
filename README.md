# Clap_Activated_LED_System
A simple Arduino-based project that uses a KY-038 sound sensor to detect claps and toggle multiple LEDs on and off. This project demonstrates basic sound-activated control using a digital sound sensor and an Arduino Mega 2560. Ideal for beginners exploring sensor integration and real-time input processing.
Clap-Activated LED Control

This project uses a KY-038 sound sensor to detect claps and toggle LEDs on and off. It is designed to work with an Arduino board.

Components Required

Arduino board

KY-038 sound sensor (using D0 pin)

3 LEDs

Resistors (220Ω recommended)

Jumper wires

Breadboard

Wiring Instructions

KY-038 Sound Sensor:

+ → Arduino 5V

G → Arduino GND

D0 → Arduino Pin 2

LEDs:

LED1 Anode (+) → Arduino Pin 3

LED2 Anode (+) → Arduino Pin 4

LED3 Anode (+) → Arduino Pin 5

Each LED Cathode (-) → Resistor → GND

How It Works

The KY-038 detects a clap and sends a signal to the Arduino.

The Arduino toggles the state of the LEDs.

A short delay prevents multiple triggers from a single clap.

Code Overview

The provided code reads the digital signal from the KY-038 and toggles the LEDs on each clap detection.

Uploading the Code

Connect your Arduino to the computer.

Open the Arduino IDE and select the correct board and port.

Copy and paste the provided code into the IDE.

Click Upload.

Usage

Clap once to turn the LEDs ON.

Clap again to turn them OFF.

Notes

Ensure the KY-038 is adjusted for proper sensitivity.

If the LEDs are not responding, check wiring and adjust the sensor's sensitivity using the onboard potentiometer.

Happy coding!
